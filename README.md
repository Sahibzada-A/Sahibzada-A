### Our Mission

1. **Open Source First**: We believe in the power of community-driven innovation, where transparent collaboration accelerates progress.  
2. **Democratizing AI**: AI should be free and accessible to all, not just locked behind corporate paywalls and exclusive research labs.  
3. **Empowering Underserved Communities**: We aim to bring advanced AI technologies to underprivileged regions to level the global playing field.  
4. **Challenging Overinflated AI Startups**: We actively strive to counter the proliferation of GPT-wrapper companies with questionable value and undeserved millions in funding.
